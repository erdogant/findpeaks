    Mean Filter Description
    -----------------------
    Apply a 'mean filter' to 'img' with a window size equal to 'win_size'.

    Parameters
    ----------
    img : array-like
        Input image.
    win_size : int, int (default: 3)
        The size of the windows.

    Returns
    -------
    img_filtered : array-like
        Filtered image.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import findpeaks
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> img = findpeaks.import_example('2dpeaks_image')
    >>> # Resize
    >>> img = findpeaks.stats.resize(img, size=(300,300))
    >>> # Make grey image
    >>> img = findpeaks.stats.togray(img)
    >>> # Scale between [0-255]
    >>> img = findpeaks.stats.scale(img)
    >>> # Filter
    >>> img_filtered = findpeaks.stats.mean_filter(img.copy(), win_size=15)
    >>>
    >>> plt.figure()
    >>> fig, axs = plt.subplots(1,2)
    >>> axs[0].imshow(img, cmap='gray'); axs[0].set_title('Input')
    >>> axs[1].imshow(img_filtered, cmap='gray'); axs[1].set_title('Mean filter')
