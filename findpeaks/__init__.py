=====================================================================

Description
-----------
findpeaks is for the detection and vizualization of peaks and valleys in a 1D-vector and 2D-array.
In case of 2D-array, the image can be pre-processed by resizing, scaling, and denoising.
Peaks are detected using the masking and the topology method.
The results can be plotted for the preprocessing steps, the persistence of peaks, the final masking plot and a 3d-mesh plot.

Examples
--------
>>> from findpeaks import findpeaks
>>> X = [9,60,377,985,1153,672,501,1068,1110,574,135,23,3,47,252,812,1182,741,263,33]
>>> fp = findpeaks(interpolate=10, lookahead=1)
>>> results = fp.fit(X)
>>> fp.plot()
>>>
>>> # 2D array example
>>> from findpeaks import findpeaks
>>> fp = findpeaks(method='topology')
>>> X = fp.import_example('2dpeaks')
>>> results = fp.fit(X)
>>> fp.plot()
>>>
>>> # Image example
>>> from findpeaks import findpeaks
>>> fp = findpeaks(method='topology', denoise='fastnl', window=30, imsize=(300,300))
>>> X = fp.import_example('2dpeaks_image')
>>> results = fp.fit(X)
>>> fp.plot()
>>>
>>> # Plot each seperately
>>> fp.plot_preprocessing()
>>> fp.plot_persistence()
>>> fp.plot_mesh()
