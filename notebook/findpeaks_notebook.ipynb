        "findpeaks is a comprehensive Python library for robust detection and analysis of peaks and valleys in both 1D vectors and 2D arrays (images). The library provides multiple detection algorithms including topology-based persistent homology (most robust), mask-based local maximum filtering, and traditional peakdetect approaches. It can be used for time series analysis, signal processing, image analysis, and spatial data. ⭐️Star it if you like it⭐️\n",

        "findpeaks is a comprehensive Python library for robust detection and analysis of peaks and valleys in both 1D vectors and 2D arrays (images). The library provides multiple detection algorithms including topology-based persistent homology (most robust), mask-based local maximum filtering, and traditional peakdetect approaches. It can be used for time series analysis, signal processing, image analysis, and spatial data. ⭐️Star it if you like it⭐️\n",
