Background
    The detection of peaks is a well known challange across various domains. Peaks indicate significant events such as sudden increase in price/volume, sharp rise in demand, bursts in data traffic. Most routinely used detection methods do not employ any assumption for peak shapes or baseline noise. All the information these peak detection methods use is that peak is a signal that goes up and comes down. A peak is detected when a threshold is exceeded[1].

Aim
    This library aims to detect peaks in both a 1-dimensional vector and 2-dimensional arrays (images) without making any assumption on the peak shape or baseline noise.
    To make sure that peaks can be detected across global and local heights, and in noisy data, multiple pre-processing and denoising methods are implemented or utilized.

Results
    Three peak-detection methods are incorporated into this package, namely *Topology*, *Mask* and *Peakdetect*. The peaks can be ranked with among others **persistence** scores. The pre-processing approaches are among others, **denoising** methods, **interpolation** and **smoothing**, **resizing** and **normalizing** methods. In addition various plots are implemented to easily intepretate the results, such as the conversion of 2d-images to **3d-mesh** plots, **persistence** plot, and **peak detection** plots.
